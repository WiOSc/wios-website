### Contributor
- As a contributor, you have the __liberty to practice new implementations__ e.g., trying out something new you learnt that could enhance the user experience or design of the WiOS website.
- If you find an issue interesting and want to work on it, kindly let the maintainers/technical lead/co-lead/admins know so that they can assign you that particular issue. This way multiple developers won't be working on the same issue.<br><br>
 *__P.S. you can also mention this as your open source contribution in your resume or while giving interview.__*
  
### Coding Standards
 - Use consistent indentation with 2 spaces (no tabs).
 - Ensure all HTML, CSS, and JS files follow a clean, readable structure.
 - Avoid unnecessary comments; ensure clarity in code.
 - Code should be modular, reusable, and organized logically.
### Naming Conventions
 - HTML Elements: Use lowercase and hyphens (kebab-case) for IDs, classes, and attributes (e.g., class="header-title").
 - CSS Classes and IDs: Use lowercase and kebab-case (e.g., .nav-bar, #main-content).
 - JavaScript: Use camelCase for functions and variables (e.g., functionName, variableName)
### Contributions
All sorts of contribution to the website are welcomed. From fixing grammatical errors to beautifying code blocks to re-designing a page, no contribution is small in our eyes. 

- Most importantly,
  - __Be consistent in the use of these guidelines when submitting.__
  - __Join__ our Open Source talks' page on [Whatsapp](https://chat.whatsapp.com/EbP55UnqDuL31dtYb93dE0), where we conduct speaker sessions from experienced coders in the field.
  - Happy coding!
